# unterwegi's dot files

This repository aims to get my own environment up and running as automatically as possible, powered by [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

The setup scripts are aware of the following Linux flavors:

- [Arch](https://archlinux.org/)
- [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
- [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/)
- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) (Mainly inside a WSL2 setup)

## Bootstrap

Optionally, install [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/install/) beforehand. The `bootstrap.sh` script does it automatically if it can't find it.

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Software needed for my setup

The following packages are automatically installed when the chezmoi config setting "installPackages" is enabled.

- git
- golang
- kitty
- npm
- tmux
- python + python-pip

## Shell Setup (fish)

My setup uses [fish](https://fishshell.com/) by default. To disable that, disable the chezmoi config setting "useFish".

The following fish plugins get installed (via [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)):

- [edc/bass](https://github.com/edc/bass)
- [ilancosman/tide@v5](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide)
- [jorgebucaran/fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)
- [nickeb96/puffer-fish](https://github.com/nickeb96/puffer-fish)
